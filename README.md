# CGG
Tasks for the university course of computer geometry and graphics.

## Tasks
- [x] [First task](src/firsttask). Drawing a function f(x) on \[a,b\]
- [x] [Second task](src/secondtask). Drawing a parabola of the type ```ax + by + c*(x - y)^2 = 0```
- [x] [Third task](src/thirdtask). Drawing a triangulation of a polygon
- [x] [Fourth task](src/fourthtask). Drawing a function f(x,y) on \[x1,x2\]Ã—\[y1,y2\]
- [ ] ~~Fifth task~~

## TODO
- [ ] **Utilities**: write comments for exporting functions and structs
- [ ] **Second Task**: use parabolaOptions separately from utility.FunctionGraph2d
- [ ] **Fourth Task**: write description for using of dimetric/isometric projections
